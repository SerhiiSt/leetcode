 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the
 * list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's
 * next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

     * Intuition
     * <p>
     * To detect if a list is cyclic,
     * we can check whether a node had been visited before.
     * A natural way is to use a hash table.
     * <p>
     * Algorithm
     * <p>
     * We go through each node one by one and record each node's
     * reference (or memory address) in a hash table.
     * If the current node is null,
     * we have reached the end of the list and it must not be cyclic.
     * If current nodeâ€™s reference is in the hash table, then return true.
